<p>Tayabas Western Academy had become not only a part of our learning journey but also in our social life. This includes our different experiences in our TLE subject such as cookery where we given a chance to actually cook inside the TLE room. This is where we apply different learnings that we gained and learned from our subject teacher, Sir Eugene Saguirer. School activities like these are very effective to our group since we were always thrilled to participate and give our best in every task that were given to us. On the other hand, we also enjoyed accompanying each other in every group activity, us Group 4 always make the best plan in our cooking activities even though it takes days to finish it. With these activities, we were able to improve our cooperation and teamwork, enhancing our abilities in socialization and work efficiency.</p>
<p>During our first cooking activity we are tasked to prepare a dish that is incorporated with a sauce. We had a hard time thinking and planning on what is the perfect and suitable dish that is best to present to the judges and also to our subject teacher until we come to our final decision that we will prepare a vegetable salad that is incorporated with a white sauce. We had struggle at first because among our groups we didn't have a member that is a experienced in the aspect of cooking but despite of the challenges we face, we still had a great outcome in doing this special dish. The judges like and are amazed by the dish we've prepared and that proves that we became successful because we work together and apply the learnings that are taught to us. We just had fun cooking and applying the lessons we've learned that it reflects the final product we presented.</p>
<p>After we experinced making sauces, we were able to cook Pork Afritada on our own. It's our first time, given that we only cooked simple dishes at school and now, we went to someone's house to cook something we never tried before. It was kind of overwhelming at first but the learnings overshadowed the fear we had. After the activity, we were able to know how important every steps of cooking meat dish is and how tenderizing techniques work on meat. Besides that, we improved our work efficiency and cooperation as a team when we worked together to accomplished our desired results. We were happy to see the results and to know that we are able to cook such a different dish but it was overall a fun experience.</p>
<p>This subject has always been part of our learning since elementary and has been part of our everyday learning in school. We learned many things and other stuff that became really helpful for us, students. We remember back then that every grade level teaches different lessons, such as tree planting, embroidery, tailoring, drafting, and of course cookery. By doing all those activities, we realized that it unleashed some of our hidden capabilities that we don't know that we can do. It is really amazing that once you start doing the things that it seems boring or uninterested for you, it will eventually make you enjoy it and cherished it.</p>
